To compile the project:

1. Download the folder "1st"
2. Run the command: "make"
3. Execute program : "./main"

The progect's code is organized by funcionalty, and each file has been declared by their header .h files, with their respective .c files where the functions with their operations are.

The info_cell_6.txt had an incorrect format in ESSID, and wouldn't allow the proper running of the program.
